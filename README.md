# Auto Open Links

This Chrome extension will **automatically open a link** if you keep the mouse pointer over the link for more than 1 second (or a custom time you can set in the oprions page). 

In the options page you can also set if you want the links to be opened in the **same tab or a new tab**.

<br/>
<div align="center" >
  <img src="Res/gifs/selection.gif" alt="Copy on Select auto copy" width="450px" style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);">
</div>
<br/>

NOTE: 
- The extension does not work on the New Tab page (the page that opens when you click on the + sign in Chrome). This is standard behaviour for all extensions.
- The extension does not work on pages whose URL starts with the word "chrome", for example chrome://extensions/ or chrome://settings/.
